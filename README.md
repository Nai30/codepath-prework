The app that I want to create would be meant to make it easier to find clothing items that we see on social media. For example, someone would be able to take a screenshot of the outfit they saw on a celebrity and put it on the app. The app will then come up with different links to pieces of clothing on the web that are, if not the same items, similar. Some additional features could be being able to focus on different items in the picture instead of all, a section of the app dedicated to recommending things the user might be interested in based on their history,and capturing pictures of items in real time to get recommendations for items similar that are cheaper. Something that would also be interesting to explore is an AI bot that acts as a personal stylist for the user. For example the user can ask the AI to provide some looks for fall and get an answer that consists of different styles people wear during fall. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-Finding where everything was situated was a bit of a challenge because Xcode is a new IDE
-Debugging was tricky since the error messages I would get weren't pointing directly to the root of the issue that I had.
-Because I took breaks in between completing the work I would forget where certain things like the assistant were . It would have been better to not take breaks and just do the work in one go.
